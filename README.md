# What?
This is the start of exploring the [pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/) library.

Pytube gives you a way of writing code in Python that let's you download YouTube videos among other things.

## My Script
My initial script (main.py) was inspired by following an article from [Siddharth Chandra](https://blog.codekaro.info/download-youtube-videos-using-python-your-own-youtube-downloader).
I added a couple of links to videos you can use to practice

## Update
- Added a progress bar, so you can see how the download is doing.
- Added some error handlling, in case you pick the wrong resolution when downloading.

## Requirements
pytube

Depending on your system you can install pytube by running:

```pip install pytube``` - Windows 10 with python 3 installed

```pip3 install pytube``` - Linux with python 2 and 3 installed
